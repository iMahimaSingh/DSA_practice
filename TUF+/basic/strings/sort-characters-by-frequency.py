"""
Sort Characters by Frequency

You are given a string s. Return the array of unique characters, sorted by highest to lowest occurring characters.
If two or more characters have same frequency then arrange them in alphabetic order.

Examples:
Input : s = "tree"
Output : ['e', 'r', 't' ]
Explanation : The occurrences of each character are as shown below :
e --> 2
r --> 1
t --> 1.
The r and t have same occurrences , so we arrange them by alphabetic order.

Input : s = "raaaajj"
Output : ['a' , 'j', 'r' ]
Explanation : The occurrences of each character are as shown below :
a --> 4
j --> 2
r --> 1

Input : s = "bbccddaaa"

Output:
['c', 'a', 'b', 'd']
['c', 'a', 'd', 'b']
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
['a', 'b', 'd', 'c']
ðŸŽ‰ Correct! Youâ€™ve earned 10 points!
Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 105
s consist of only lowercase English characters.
